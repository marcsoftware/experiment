Spring's container handles the lifecycle of a bean through a complex series of steps. 
In general, the setup phase involves instantiation of the empty object, 
handling of its dependencies, initialization of properties and default values, 
and any custom initialization methods before the bean is ready for use within the program.
The teardown phase dereferences the bean when it passes out of scope (or the container is itself shutdown),
but also calls any custom destroy methods along the way.
