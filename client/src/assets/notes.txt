spring is built upon an IOC container.
spring is a modular framework.
spring can be configured an deployed without need for an application server.
spring  can be deployed as a selfexecuting server.
---
spring has IOC container
objects handles by the IoC container are called beans
-instantiated -deplyed -destroyed
IOC container is called the application context or Beanfactory
IOC goal is to decoupe configuration from exectution
-loosely coupled
Inversion of Control - bean does not control the process of contructing its dependencies

---
IOC ---> spring-core spring-beans spring-context
application context has replaced Beanfactorybeanfactory only had singleton scope & lazy instantiation
application context eager instantiation and five scopes
@autowire automagicaly figures out dependencies
OOP - smallest unit is the object . AOP - smallest unit is an aspect
an aspect is a cross cutting concern.
-logging -configuration -validation -testing
AOP interceptors : advice = action. join point = method recieves injection. pointcut is the expression
